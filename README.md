# MTL-Diary
This is a site which show casas pictures of the city of Montreal and allows user to buy them. This site was developed in HTML,CSS and Javascript no frameworks are used in this site.  
User can add products in cart and then go to check out. It also allows user to edit cart before placing an order. 
While check out it also validates details of a user.
User can also search for a product with a keyword, if its available it will scroll page to that product and highlight the tag of that product.
User can also view image by clicking on it
My main purpuse to develop this project was to practice basics of HTML,CSS and Javascript.
